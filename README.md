Html table fetching data from weatherstackapi

1- To run the app you're gonna need an api key, you can get one for free from https://weatherstack.com/product
2- Once you got the api key, write it on the init.js file placed in the js folder, save it.
3- Now you should be able to run the app from your browser, and fetch the data pressing the button "Get Data".
